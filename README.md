# API for Earthquake Information

## Main idea:
> While working for one of the final projects for the Data Analytics Bootcamp last year, my teammates and I  encountered that some of the datasets available were not as large as we would've like. We chose our project to be related to earthquakes. The main reason: the USGS has readily available data from their website. However, when wanting to download data, it is basically limited to about 2 months worth of data, if wanting to include events with very low magnitude. I decided to test how to create and deply an API that was updated regularly with the monthly data from USGS.


### Objectives:

+ Obtain the information from: https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/earthquakes
+ Place the information collected as part of a database to be accessed for data exploration, data visualization,training the model(s), etc.
+ Create and deploy an API with the information.
+ Regularly maintain the database and the API by updating and adding the new earthquake information so the dataset is relatively large.

### Steps:

1. Import the necessary dependencies. 
2. Database were created ahead of time for a different project. Connect to the databases and access the data.
3.
